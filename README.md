# Aurora: State-of-the-Art Synthetic Intelligence Code Writer

This is a simplified implementation of Aurora, a SOTA Synthetic Intelligence designed for generating high-quality code.

## Architecture

Aurora consists of the following components:

- **Primary Code Model**: Generates initial code based on prompts.
- **Specialist Models**:
  - Security Auditor: Checks for security vulnerabilities.
  - Optimizer: Suggests performance improvements.
  - Documentation Model: Generates docstrings and comments.
  - Explainer Model: Provides natural language explanations.
- **Reasoning Engine**: Uses Tree-of-Thoughts approach to plan solutions.
- **Contextual Workspace**: Maintains context from prompts and history.
- **Code Sandbox**: Executes and tests generated code.

## Usage

Run the script to see an example with FizzBuzz:

```bash
python aurora.py
```

## Features

- Mock implementation for demonstration.
- Supports FizzBuzz generation.
- Includes security auditing, optimization suggestions, and code execution.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate real AI models (e.g., via Transformers).
- Implement full Tree-of-Thoughts reasoning.
- Add more prompts and code types.
- Continuous learning from feedback.
