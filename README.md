# Aurora: State-of-the-Art Synthetic Intelligence Code Writer

This is a complete implementation of Aurora, a SOTA Synthetic Intelligence designed for generating high-quality code with multi-pipeline architecture and quantum compression.

## Architecture

Aurora consists of the following components:

- **Primary Code Model**: Generates initial code based on prompts.
- **Specialist Models**:
  - Security Auditor: Checks for security vulnerabilities.
  - Optimizer: Suggests performance improvements.
  - Documentation Model: Generates docstrings and comments.
  - Explainer Model: Provides natural language explanations.
- **Reasoning Engine**: Uses Tree-of-Thoughts approach to plan solutions.
- **Contextual Workspace**: Maintains context from prompts and history.
- **Code Sandbox**: Executes and tests generated code.
- **Quantum Compression**: Allows Aurora to be trained and updated while compressed.

## New Features

### Multi-Pipeline Architecture
- 5 parallel processing pipelines
- 100 fiber optic threads per pipeline for efficient data processing
- Quantum-inspired compression and decompression

### Hugging Face Dataset Integration
- Automatic loading from "bigcode/the-stack-v2" dataset
- Continuous training on web-sourced code
- Graceful fallback to built-in training data

### Quantum Compressed Operation
- Runs directly from compressed ZIP file: `python aurora_quantum.zip`
- Can be trained and updated while compressed
- Self-modifying capabilities with persistent state

## Usage

### Basic Aurora
```bash
python aurora.py
```

### Compressed Aurora (Quantum Mode)
```bash
python aurora_quantum.zip
```

### Running Tests and Demos
```bash
python test_basic.py      # Basic functionality tests
python demo_training.py   # Training demonstration
```

## Commands (Interactive Mode)

- Enter a code prompt to generate code
- Type `train` to continue training from web sources
- Type `status` to see current training statistics
- Type `quit` to exit

## Features

- **Dataset Training**: Integrates with Hugging Face datasets for continuous learning
- **Quantum Compression**: Compressed operation with real-time updates
- **Pattern Recognition**: Advanced code pattern learning and generation
- **Semicolon Preference**: Generates code using semicolons as preferred separators
- **Continuous Learning**: Self-improvement through streaming data
- **Multi-threaded Processing**: Parallel data processing and training
